This repo holds various DeFi experiments (prototypes) using
Apocryph Agents in various languages (C#, Java, JavaScript).

The goals of the experiments are:
1. Serve as learning materials
2. Ehnance / Validate agents development model

## Agents

Agents are grouped in functional areas (e.g. `agents/token-management). 
Every functional area is implemented in a single language. The 
functional area also contains in-proc test 
environment.

## Environment

There various environments that can be used for executing the agents. 
The first enviornment that we have implemented is `test/dotnet`. 
It is usefull for initial development, troubleshooting and learning of
C# based agents.

## Pre-requisites
